# This is a test parfile
# The file parser is very stupid:
# - it will ignore lines starting with '#' , and 
# - it will look for strings '<key>=<value>'
# be sure not to format properly the parfile and do not leave spaces ...
#
# example for spherical puncture 
#
verbose=1
par_m_plus=0.9
# be also sure not to leave blank lines after this.
